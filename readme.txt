To update your Dr Jones Trader to include 1.18 additions, if you have a completely vanilla (no other mods / additions) setup,
 simply upload the included TraderConfig.txt file over the exisiting file inside your Servers Trader folder, which will be in
 your servers profiles / config / settings (it can have different names) folder. Save & Restart Server.
 
 If you have a custom setup, below are the additions that came with update 1.18, simply add them to your exisiting TraderConfig.txt file in the correct place. Please note
 that the "Launchers and Ammo" & "Explosives and Detonators" category names are NEW, so will need adding too, whereas "Sidearms" and "Grenades" already have that
 category name in the file, so just add the items and prices. Upload, Save & Restart.
